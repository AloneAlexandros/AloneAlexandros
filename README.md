## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a mobile game!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning swift and iOS dev.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, as long as it's something I know how to do
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: alex.samonakis@gmail.com or discord on @alonealexandros
- âš¡ Fun fact: I forgot to make a README.md, even thought I've been using github for more than two years!
